# Ticket Persistence Fix - Database Storage

## Problem
Generated tickets were disappearing after page refresh because they were only stored in React component state, not fetched from the database on page load.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Database Fetch on Page Load
**File**: `/app/admin/enhanced-ticket-generator/page.tsx`

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchEvents()
  fetchGeneratedTickets() // NEW: Fetch tickets from database
}, [])
```

### 2. Created fetchGeneratedTickets Function
Fetches all enhanced tickets from the database on component mount:

```javascript
const fetchGeneratedTickets = async () => {
  // Fetch tickets with ticket_type = 'enhanced'
  const query = supabase
    .from('tickets')
    .select(`
      *,
      events (
        id,
        title,
        date,
        time,
        venue
      )
    `)
    .or('ticket_type.eq.enhanced,ticket_type.eq.Enhanced')
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  
  // Load tickets and display them
  setGeneratedTickets(transformedTickets)
}
```

### 3. Updated Delete Function
Now properly deletes from database:

```javascript
const deleteTicket = async (ticketId) => {
  // Delete from database
  await supabase
    .from('tickets')
    .delete()
    .eq('id', ticketId)
  
  // Update local state
  setGeneratedTickets(prev => prev.filter(ticket => ticket.id !== ticketId))
}
```

### 4. Refresh After Generation
After generating new tickets, fetch the updated list:

```javascript
const result = await response.json()
// Refresh tickets from database
await fetchGeneratedTickets()
```

### 5. Added Loading States
- Loading indicator while fetching tickets
- Prevents confusion during data load

## How It Works Now

### Before Fix:
1. Generate tickets → Stored in database ✅
2. Tickets shown in UI (from state) ✅
3. Refresh page → State cleared ❌
4. Tickets disappear from UI ❌

### After Fix:
1. Generate tickets → Stored in database ✅
2. Tickets shown in UI ✅
3. Refresh page → Fetch from database ✅
4. Tickets persist in UI ✅

## Verification

### Test Steps:
1. Generate some enhanced tickets
2. Verify they appear in the list
3. Refresh the page (F5)
4. Tickets should still be visible
5. Delete a ticket
6. Refresh again - deleted ticket should remain gone

### Database Check:
```sql
-- Check if tickets are in database
SELECT * FROM tickets 
WHERE ticket_type IN ('enhanced', 'Enhanced')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Benefits

✅ **Data Persistence**: Tickets survive page refreshes
✅ **Database Truth**: UI reflects actual database state
✅ **Role-Based Access**: Admins see all, organizers see their own
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Changes immediately reflected
✅ **Loading States**: Clear feedback during data operations

## Technical Details

### Data Flow:
1. **Page Load**: `fetchGeneratedTickets()` queries database
2. **Generate**: API creates tickets → Database → Refresh list
3. **Delete**: Remove from database → Update state
4. **Download**: Fetch from database with full data

### Database Schema:
- Tickets stored with `ticket_type = 'Enhanced'`
- Linked to events via `event_id`
- Contains metadata with all template information
- Includes seat allocation if applicable

## Result

Tickets are now properly:
- ✅ Stored in database when generated
- ✅ Fetched from database on page load
- ✅ Persist across page refreshes
- ✅ Deleted from database when removed
- ✅ Available for download anytime
