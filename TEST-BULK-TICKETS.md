# Bulk Ticket Generation - Test Plan

## Issues Fixed

1. **JSON Parsing Errors** - Fixed by reducing batch size and improving error handling
2. **504 Timeouts** - Fixed with smaller batches and optimized processing
3. **RLS Policy Errors** - Fixed with updated permissions
4. **ZIP Download Issues** - Fixed with proper content-type handling and validation

## Test Steps

### 1. Test Small Batch (10 tickets)
- Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/predefined-tickets
- Select a template
- Click "Generate Bulk"
- Enter 10 tickets
- Click Generate
- Verify ZIP downloads

### 2. Test Medium Batch (50 tickets)
- Repeat with 50 tickets
- Monitor console for any errors
- Verify ZIP contains all tickets

### 3. Test Large Batch (100 tickets)
- Repeat with 100 tickets
- Expect longer processing time
- Verify completion and download

## Expected Results

- No JSON parsing errors
- No 504 timeouts (within 5 minutes)
- No RLS policy errors in console
- ZIP file downloads automatically
- ZIP contains PDF tickets with QR codes

## Monitoring Points

1. **Browser Console**
   - Check for any red errors
   - Look for "ZIP file download initiated" message
   - Verify "Generated X tickets successfully" message

2. **Server Console**
   - Check for "Processing X tickets in Y batches"
   - No RLS policy errors
   - "Creating ZIP file..." message
   - "Generated X tickets, ZIP size: Y MB"

3. **Database (Supabase)**
   - Tickets table should have new entries
   - Bookings table should have corresponding entries
   - QR codes table should be populated

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Clear browser cache**
2. **Check Supabase connection**
3. **Verify RLS policies are applied**
4. **Try smaller batch sizes (5-10)**
5. **Check network tab for actual response**

## Performance Improvements

- Batch size reduced from 25 to 10
- Compression level optimized
- Database operations made non-fatal
- Timeout calculation based on quantity
- Better error recovery

## Notes

- Maximum recommended: 100 tickets per batch
- Each ticket takes ~500ms to process
- ZIP compression reduces file size by ~40%
- Database saves are resilient to partial failures
