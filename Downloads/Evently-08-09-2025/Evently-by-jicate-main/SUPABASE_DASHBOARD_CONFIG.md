# ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Supabase Dashboard Configuration

## THE PROBLEM
Supabase is redirecting to: `https://sdkdi...supabase.co/evently-by-jicate.vercel.app?code=...`
This is WRONG. It should redirect to: `https://evently-by-jicate.vercel.app/auth/callback?code=...`

## THE SOLUTION - You MUST do this in Supabase Dashboard

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sdkdimqmzunfmyawtqfy/auth/url-configuration

### Step 2: Configure Site URL
In the **Site URL** field, enter EXACTLY:
```
https://evently-by-jicate.vercel.app
```

### Step 3: Configure Redirect URLs
In the **Redirect URLs** section, add THESE EXACT URLS (one per line):
```
https://evently-by-jicate.vercel.app
https://evently-by-jicate.vercel.app/auth
https://evently-by-jicate.vercel.app/auth/callback
https://evently-by-jicate.vercel.app/api/auth/callback
http://localhost:3000
http://localhost:3000/auth
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
http://localhost:3001
http://localhost:3001/auth
http://localhost:3001/auth/callback
```

### Step 4: SAVE Configuration
Click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page.

### Step 5: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Step 6: Test Again
Try signing in with Google again.

## If it STILL doesn't work:

### Check Google OAuth Configuration
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Click on your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Make sure these are in **Authorized redirect URIs**:
```
https://sdkdimqmzunfmyawtqfy.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
```

### Alternative: Use Email/Password Authentication
If OAuth continues to fail, you can use email/password authentication which doesn't require redirect URLs:
1. Sign up with email and password
2. Check your email for verification link
3. Click the link to verify your account
4. Sign in with your email and password

## What the code does now:
- Simplified OAuth flow without explicit redirect URLs
- Multiple callback routes to catch any redirect pattern
- Removed middleware interference
- Added error handling page

The issue is 100% in the Supabase Dashboard configuration. The redirect URLs MUST be configured correctly.
