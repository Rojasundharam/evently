# Event Creation Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Multiple Duplicate Event Creation
**Problem**: Events were being created 3-4 times automatically when user submitted the form
**Solution**: 
- Added `submissionRef` using `useRef` to track submission state
- Added unique request ID generation for each submission
- Implemented request deduplication on the server side
- Added multiple guards to prevent duplicate submissions

### 2. Authentication Errors (401 Unauthorized)
**Problem**: API calls were failing with 401 authentication errors
**Solution**:
- Added retry logic with session refresh in the API route
- Implemented automatic session refresh on client side
- Added 3 retry attempts with delay for authentication
- Better error handling with user-friendly messages

### 3. Form Auto-submission Issue
**Problem**: Events were created automatically before user finished customizing
**Solution**:
- Added confirmation dialog before submission
- Prevented form submission on Enter key (except in textarea)
- Added "Save Draft" functionality
- Clear submission guards in finally block

## Code Changes

### `/app/api/events/route.ts`
```typescript
// Added request deduplication
const ongoingRequests = new Map<string, Promise<NextResponse>>()

// Added retry logic for authentication
let retries = 3
while (retries > 0) {
  const result = await supabase.auth.getUser()
  if (user) break
  // Try refreshing session if failed
  await supabase.auth.getSession()
  retries--
}
```

### `/app/events/create/page.tsx`
```typescript
// Added submission guards
const submissionRef = useRef(false)
const requestIdRef = useRef<string | null>(null)

// Prevent duplicate submissions
if (submissionRef.current || isSubmitting) {
  return
}

// Generate unique request ID
const requestId = `req_${Date.now()}_${Math.random()}`

// Add request ID to headers
headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'X-Request-Id': requestIdRef.current || '',
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a new event and verify it's only created once
- [ ] Check console logs for any duplicate submission attempts
- [ ] Verify authentication works correctly
- [ ] Test form validation
- [ ] Test image upload
- [ ] Test seat configuration
- [ ] Test ticket template
- [ ] Verify confirmation dialog appears before submission
- [ ] Test "Save Draft" functionality
- [ ] Ensure Enter key doesn't submit form prematurely

## Additional Notes

The system now has multiple layers of protection:
1. Client-side submission guards (useRef and state)
2. Unique request IDs for deduplication
3. Server-side request caching
4. Authentication retry logic
5. User confirmation before submission

These changes should prevent the duplicate event creation and authentication issues completely.
