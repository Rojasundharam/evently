# Fix Authentication and Profile Creation Issues

## Problem
The application is experiencing 409 conflict errors when creating user profiles due to:
1. Race conditions between database triggers and application code
2. Missing proper RLS policies for profile insertion
3. Multiple simultaneous profile creation attempts

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Application Code
- **lib/auth-helpers.ts**: Changed `insert` to `upsert` to handle conflicts gracefully
- **hooks/use-auth-simple.tsx**: Added profile fetch locking to prevent race conditions
- Improved error handling and reduced timeout durations

### 2. Database Migration
Run the following SQL file to fix database-level issues:
```bash
# Apply the database migration
supabase db push --file supabase/fix-profile-creation-conflicts.sql
```

Or manually execute the SQL in your Supabase dashboard.

### 3. Key Changes Made

#### Application Level:
- Used `upsert` instead of `insert` for profile creation
- Added fallback profile fetching when upsert fails
- Implemented profile fetch locking to prevent simultaneous attempts
- Reduced timeout durations for better UX
- Improved error logging (reduced noise from expected timeout errors)

#### Database Level:
- Fixed RLS policies to allow proper profile insertion
- Improved `handle_new_user` trigger function with better conflict handling
- Added proper admin role assignment for `sroja@jkkn.ac.in`
- Added service role permissions for backend operations

## Expected Results
After applying these fixes:
1. ✅ No more 409 conflict errors during profile creation
2. ✅ Proper role assignment (admin for sroja@jkkn.ac.in, user for others)
3. ✅ Faster authentication flow with reduced timeouts
4. ✅ Better error handling and user experience
5. ✅ Proper access control based on user roles

## Testing
1. Clear browser storage and cookies
2. Sign out and sign in again
3. Verify profile is created without errors
4. Check that roles are properly assigned
5. Test navigation based on user role

## Rollback
If issues persist, you can rollback by:
1. Reverting the application code changes
2. Running the original schema.sql file
