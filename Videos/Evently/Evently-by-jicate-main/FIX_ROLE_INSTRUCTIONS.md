# Fix for User Role Update Issue

## Problem Identified
The user role updates were not persisting due to:
1. Database triggers resetting roles on login
2. Conflicting role data in auth metadata
3. Frontend code overriding database roles
4. Caching issues preventing role updates from showing

## Solution Applied

### 1. Database Changes (FIX-ROLE-UPDATE-ISSUE.sql)
- Removed all interfering triggers
- Cleared role data from auth metadata
- Made profiles table the single source of truth
- Created safe role update function
- Fixed RLS policies

### 2. Frontend Changes (auth-helpers.ts)
- Removed hardcoded role assignments
- Prevented role overrides on login
- Made profile fetching respect existing roles

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run the SQL Script
Execute the SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of:
-- supabase/FIX-ROLE-UPDATE-ISSUE.sql
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Clear Site Data
4. Sign out and sign back in

### Step 3: Test Role Updates
1. Go to Admin Panel > User Management
2. Update a user's role
3. Have the user refresh their page
4. The role should now persist correctly

## Verification Steps

1. Check that roles persist after logout/login
2. Verify real-time updates work (role changes reflect immediately)
3. Confirm no role resets occur during navigation
4. Test all role types (user, organizer, admin)

## Important Notes

- Users may need to sign out and back in after their role is updated
- The profiles table is now the ONLY source of truth for roles
- Auth metadata no longer stores or influences roles
- All role updates must go through the admin panel

## Troubleshooting

If roles still don't persist:
1. Check for any remaining triggers: 
   ```sql
   SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger 
   WHERE tgrelid = 'auth.users'::regclass 
   AND tgisinternal = false;
   ```

2. Verify no role in auth metadata:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth.users 
   WHERE raw_user_meta_data ? 'role';
   -- Should return 0
   ```

3. Check profile exists for user:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM profiles 
   WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
   ```

## Success Indicators
✅ Role updates persist across sessions
✅ No role resets on login
✅ Real-time updates work
✅ Admin can change any user's role
✅ Changes take effect immediately
