# 🚨 URGENT: Fix Supabase Storage Manually

## The Problem
- **Error**: `42501: must be owner of table objects`
- **Issue**: Cannot create storage policies via SQL due to permission restrictions
- **Impact**: Event banner images cannot be uploaded

## ✅ Quick Solution (Do This First!)

### Option 1: Manual Fix in Supabase Dashboard

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sdkdimqmzunfmyawtqfy

2. **Navigate to Storage Section**
   - Click on "Storage" in the left sidebar

3. **Create or Update the Bucket**
   - If `event-images` bucket doesn't exist:
     - Click "New bucket"
     - Name: `event-images`
     - **IMPORTANT**: Toggle "Public bucket" to **ON** ✅
     - File size limit: 10MB
     - Allowed MIME types: Leave empty (allows all images)
     - Click "Create"
   
   - If `event-images` bucket exists:
     - Click on the bucket
     - Click Settings (gear icon)
     - Toggle "Public bucket" to **ON** ✅
     - Save changes

4. **Configure Bucket Policies** (in Storage section)
   - Click on `event-images` bucket
   - Go to "Policies" tab
   - Add these policies:

   **Policy 1: Allow public to view**
   - Name: `Allow public read`
   - Operation: SELECT
   - Target roles: anon, authenticated
   - WITH CHECK: `true`

   **Policy 2: Allow authenticated to upload**
   - Name: `Allow authenticated upload`
   - Operation: INSERT
   - Target roles: authenticated
   - WITH CHECK: `auth.uid() IS NOT NULL`

### Option 2: Use Supabase Storage API Settings

1. Go to **Settings > API** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Find the "Storage" section
3. Enable "Allow public uploads to public buckets"
4. Save changes

## 🔧 Alternative: Bypass Storage Temporarily

The code has been updated to:
- Skip image uploads automatically if storage fails
- Continue creating events without images
- No more repeated error messages

## 📝 Test Your Fix

1. Visit: http://localhost:3000/test-storage
2. Check storage status
3. Run the upload test
4. Try creating an event again

## 🎯 What's Happening Now

- **Event Creation**: Will work WITHOUT images
- **Ticket Generation**: Still works with QR codes
- **Database Storage**: All ticket data is saved properly

## 💡 Important Notes

- Your Supabase project: `sdkdimqmzunfmyawtqfy`
- Storage is OPTIONAL for events
- Tickets and QR codes work independently of storage
- Events can be created without images

## 🚀 Long-term Solution

Consider using alternative image storage:
1. Cloudinary (free tier available)
2. AWS S3
3. Base64 encoded images in database
4. External image URLs

## ✨ Current Status

- ✅ Events can be created
- ✅ Tickets are generated with QR codes
- ✅ All data stored in Supabase database
- ⚠️ Image uploads temporarily disabled
- ✅ System continues to work without images

**No need to panic!** The system works fine without images. Fix storage when convenient.
