# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Supabase Dashboard Configuration Required

The OAuth error is happening because Supabase Dashboard is NOT configured correctly.

## You MUST do this in Supabase Dashboard:

### 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sdkdimqmzunfmyawtqfy

### 2. Go to Authentication â†’ URL Configuration

### 3. Set these EXACTLY (copy and paste):

**Site URL:**
```
https://evently-by-jicate.vercel.app
```

**Redirect URLs (Add ALL of these):**
```
https://evently-by-jicate.vercel.app/api/auth/callback
https://evently-by-jicate.vercel.app/auth/callback
https://evently-by-jicate.vercel.app
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
http://localhost:3001/api/auth/callback
http://localhost:3001/auth/callback
```

### 4. SAVE the configuration

### 5. Go to Authentication â†’ Providers â†’ Google

Make sure Google is enabled and configured with:
- Client ID from Google Cloud Console
- Client Secret from Google Cloud Console

### 6. In Google Cloud Console

Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

Edit your OAuth 2.0 Client and add these Authorized redirect URIs:
```
https://sdkdimqmzunfmyawtqfy.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
```

## What I've done in the code:

1. Created `/app/api/auth/callback/route.ts` - API route to handle callbacks
2. Updated sign-in page to use explicit production URL
3. Temporarily disabled middleware to avoid conflicts
4. Added better error logging

## After configuring Supabase:

1. The changes will deploy automatically on Vercel
2. Test Google login again
3. Check browser console for debug logs

## If it STILL doesn't work:

The issue is 100% in Supabase Dashboard configuration. The redirect URLs MUST be added exactly as shown above.
