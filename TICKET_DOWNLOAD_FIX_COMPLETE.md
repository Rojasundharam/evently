# Ticket Download Fix - Complete Solution

## Issue Fixed
The ticket download was showing placeholder data ("TEMP-ID", "Event Name", etc.) instead of actual event information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed PDF Generation in `/app/api/tickets/download-with-template/route.ts`
- Replaced simplified PDF generation with proper data mapping
- Now uses actual ticket and event data instead of placeholders
- Enhanced PDF layout with proper formatting:
  - Event title, date, time, venue
  - Attendee information
  - Ticket number
  - QR code placeholder
  - Terms and conditions from template

### 2. Updated Download Functions in Multiple Components

#### `/app/tickets/page.tsx`
```typescript
// Changed from downloading just QR code to full ticket PDF
const downloadTicket = async (ticket: TicketData) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/tickets/download-with-template', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      ticketId: ticket.id,
      format: 'pdf'
    })
  })
  // ... download PDF with actual data
}
```

#### `/components/tickets/ticket-popup.tsx`
- Already using the correct download API
- Downloads full ticket PDF with template

### 3. Data Flow for Tickets

1. **Event Creation** (`/app/events/create/page.tsx`)
   - Ticket template is saved with event
   - Template includes: colors, layout, terms, organizer info

2. **Booking Creation** (`/app/api/bookings/route.ts`)
   - User books tickets for event
   - Booking links to event with template

3. **Ticket Generation** (`/app/api/tickets/generate/route.ts`)
   - Creates tickets with:
     - Encrypted QR code
     - Event details
     - Template metadata
     - User information

4. **Ticket Download** (`/app/api/tickets/download-with-template/route.ts`)
   - Fetches ticket with booking and event data
   - Uses event's ticket template
   - Generates PDF with actual data:
     ```
     Ticket ID: TKT-ABC123 (not TEMP-ID)
     Event: Actual Event Title
     Date: Actual Event Date
     Venue: Actual Venue Name
     ```

## How It Works Now

### When Creating an Event:
1. Organizer customizes ticket template
2. Template is saved with event in database
3. Template includes all visual and content preferences

### When User Books Tickets:
1. Booking references the event
2. Tickets are generated with actual data
3. Each ticket has unique number and encrypted QR

### When Downloading Tickets:
1. System fetches ticket → booking → event → template
2. PDF is generated with:
   - Real event information
   - Actual attendee details
   - Customized template design
   - Proper ticket number (not TEMP-ID)

## Testing the Fix

1. **Create an Event**:
   - Enable ticket template
   - Customize colors and layout
   - Save event

2. **Book Tickets**:
   - Go to event page
   - Book tickets
   - Complete payment

3. **Download Ticket**:
   - Go to My Tickets page
   - Click download on any ticket
   - PDF should show:
     - Actual event name (not "Event Name")
     - Real ticket number (not "TEMP-ID")
     - Correct date, time, venue
     - Attendee name
     - Custom template design

## Key Files Modified

1. `/app/api/tickets/download-with-template/route.ts` - Main fix for PDF generation
2. `/app/tickets/page.tsx` - Updated download function
3. `/app/api/tickets/generate/route.ts` - Ensures template data is stored

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix works:

```bash
# 1. Check if ticket has template data
SELECT ticket_template FROM events WHERE id = 'your-event-id';

# 2. Check if tickets have proper metadata
SELECT metadata FROM tickets WHERE booking_id = 'your-booking-id';

# 3. Test download
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/tickets/download-with-template \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ticketId": "your-ticket-id", "format": "pdf"}'
```

## Result

Now when users download tickets, they get:
- Professional PDF with actual event details
- Customized design from event's ticket template  
- Real ticket numbers and attendee information
- No more placeholder text like "TEMP-ID" or "Event Name"

The ticket download system is now fully functional with proper data mapping from events to tickets!
