# Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue
The deployed application shows: `{"error":"requested path is invalid"}`

## Root Cause
This error typically occurs due to:
1. Incorrect Next.js configuration for Vercel
2. Missing or incorrect routing configuration
3. Environment variable issues
4. Middleware configuration problems

## Fixes Applied

### 1. âœ… Created `vercel.json`
- Added proper rewrites for routing
- Configured environment variables
- Added security headers

### 2. âœ… Updated `next.config.js`
- Removed `output: 'standalone'` (not needed for Vercel)
- Added proper redirects and rewrites
- Fixed routing configuration

### 3. ðŸ”„ Next Steps for Deployment

#### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment configuration"
git push
```

#### Step 2: Redeploy on Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Click "Redeploy" or trigger a new deployment
4. Make sure environment variables are set:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`
   - `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`

#### Step 3: Check Environment Variables
Make sure all environment variables are properly set in Vercel:
- Go to Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables
- Add all variables from your `.env.local` file

#### Step 4: Domain Configuration
If using a custom domain, make sure:
- Domain is properly configured in Vercel
- DNS settings are correct
- SSL certificate is active

## Expected Result
After redeployment, the application should:
- Load properly without "requested path is invalid" error
- Handle routing correctly
- Work with authentication flow
- Display admin navigation for admin users

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Check Vercel build logs for errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check if API routes are working
4. Test authentication flow in production
